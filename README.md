# The Monkees


# UX

This project is a website created for a 60's rock band called "The Monkees". 
The band wanted the website to create a place for there fans to be able to view and listen to their favourite music and be able to get in touch about viewing or booking them for events. 
The Monkees also wanted a platform for them to show off their social media which will allow the fans to see further into what the band are up to and be able to communicate with the band and the other fans from around the world.

 My main idea for the design of this website was to make it as user friendly as possible.
 I have designed this website so that it is sleek, minimal and easy to navigate.
