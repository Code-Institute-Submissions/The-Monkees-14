# The Monkees

 This project is a website created for a 60's rock band called "The Monkees". 
The band wanted the website to create a place for their fans to be able to view and listen to their favourite music and be able to get in touch about viewing or booking them for events. 
The Monkees also wanted a platform for them to show off their social media which will allow the fans to see further into what the band are up to and be able to communicate with the band and the other fans from around the world.

 My main idea for the design of this website was to make it as user friendly as possible.
I have designed this website so that it is sleek, minimal and easy to navigate.

## UX

 The main focus throughout creating this website was to create a way for people to find out everything there is to know about The Monkees. 
Fans and people who are just learning about The Monkees can discover infomation all about the band members, listen to their music, find out where the band are play, look to buy tickets and even get in contact if they wish to book the band for events.

### User Stories

*As the developer I created a button so that the user can be linked to a website so that they can buy tickets online.

*As a fan I want to be notified so that I find out on the news about the band whenever or where ever I am.
*As the developer i created a form at the bottom of each page which users input there email information so that they can be informed on the news about the band.

*As a fan I want a form to fill out so that I can get in touch with the band about booking them for events.
*As a developer I created a contact page which includes a form for users to be able to fill out so that they can contact the band about booking them for events.

## Features

 *In the next section of the site there is three small columns which show a brief overview of some of the other pages information so that if the user only wanted to see the bands lastest events or some of there music.

### Music Page

 *The page then has an embedded Apple Music Playlist with some of The Monkees greatest hits. This player allows them to listen to their songs and also allows them to click the link to Apple Music and discover even more of the bands music.
