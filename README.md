# The Monkees

 This project is a website created for a 60's rock band called "The Monkees". 
The band wanted the website to create a place for their fans to be able to view and listen to their favourite music and be able to get in touch about viewing or booking them for events. 
The Monkees also wanted a platform for them to show off their social media which will allow the fans to see further into what the band are up to and be able to communicate with the band and the other fans from around the world.

 My main idea for the design of this website was to make it as user friendly as possible.
I have designed this website so that it is sleek, minimal and easy to navigate.

## UX

 The main focus throughout creating this website was to create a way for people to find out everything there is to know about The Monkees. 
Fans and people who are just learning about The Monkees can discover information all about the band members, listen to their music, find out where the band are playing, look to buy tickets and even get in contact if they wish to book the band for events.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to press a button so that I can buy tickets quick and easy for the upcoming band events.

* As a user, I want to be notified so that I find out on the news about the band whenever or where ever I am.

* As a user, I want link to be able to find the bands social media sites so that I can see what the band are up to.

* As a user, I want a form to fill out so that I can get in touch with the band about booking them for events.

* As a user, I want a music player so that I can listen to the bands archive of old and new music.

### Wireframes

To create my wireframes / mock-ups I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtbnjBRDBARIsAO3zDl8y1A5TYW0QA6aPoyr9ytabzrZnxGZamaNToi0F9TjmtMYoHPUXkscaAsVvEALw_wcB). I have added a folder with the .png images inside.

## Features 

### Navigation

 * The navigation was designed to be easy and simple to use. Each page has a float effect when hovered over so that the user can easily see which direction the user is going to go. 
 * The navigation has social media links so that no matter which page you are on the user can always be one click away from the bands social media.
 * The navigation is in the exact same format throughout the site so that the user does not get confused. 
 * It also becomes a drop-down navigation when using mobile resolution so that it takes up less screen space, allowing more information to be shown.

### Front Page

 * The front page starts with a full width image of The Monkees so that the user knows exactly what the site is all about when first entering.

### Mid-Section 

 * The mid-section is the same throughout the site and this was created as another way that the user could quickly move to another page with just one click. It also gives a small brief on the page before entering.

### Bio Page

 * The bio page has an image of each individual in the band and some information all about them to give the user a chance to get to know each band member and their back stories.
 * The information is also linked to the sites which the information was taken from so that if the user wants to read more they can.

### Music Page

 * The Music page starts with one of The Monkees music videos which has a video player with controls to give the user the control.
 * The page then has an embedded Apple Music Playlist with some of The Monkees greatest hits. This player allows them to listen to their songs and also allows them to click the link to Apple Music and discover even more of The Monkees music.

### Events Page

 * The events page is designed so that the user can simply check the bands upcoming events. 
 * Buttons were added to allow the user to be able to purchase tickets to the events. 

### Contact Page

 * The Contact page is a form which the user will enter their full name and email. Within the form there as a subject dropdown to give the band more info on why the user is contacting them. 
 * Then a text area at the bottom of the form for the user to type out all the information they wish to give to the band about bookings or events.

### Footer

 * The footer is the same throughout on every page to keep the site simple from the user.
 * The footer consists of a form which will allow the user to enter their email address and be emailed news and information about the bands music, events and their whereabouts.
 * The footer also has social media links on every page to allow the user easy access to the bands social media using one click.

#### Features to be implemented 

 * Another feature which could be added in the future could be a merchandise page which would allow the user to buy The Monkees branded clothing and accessories.
